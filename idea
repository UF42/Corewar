live and jump do not have codage;

st	-> 4 bytes;
sti	-> 2 bytes;

ld 02 XX XXXX XX

- load the killer (what will be written to the map): 

	4 processes on the same position:

	reg_x_1	->	01-ff-ff-ff;	-> 1. live;
	reg_x_2	->	ff-ob-64-rx;	-> 2. sti;
	reg_x_3	->	dx-dx-rx-09;	-> 3. zjmp;
	reg_x_4	->	xx-xx-01-ff;	-> 4. garbage;

1 process:

1. load the value to the registers;
2. 4 sti commands to write to the correspondent place on the map;
3.

st st st st zjmp to the first st;
